    <h1>Sundarbans: The Largest Mangrove Forest of The Earth</h1>

    <p>orest is the lung of the Mother Earth. Without forest it’s impossible to live in the world. That’s mean no forest no life. The word “forest” comes from old French word forest (also fores). And the Bans word derives from the English Word Forest. The first known forests on Earth arose in the Late Devonian (approximately 380 million years ago), with the evolution of Archaeopteryx.</p>
    <p>The Bengali name Sundarban Bengali: Sundarban means "beautiful forest." It may have been derived from the word Sundari or Sundri, the local name of the mangrove species Heritiera fomes. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the name is a corruption of Samudraban, Shomudrobôn ("Sea Forest"), or Chandra-bandhe, the name of a tribe.

<p>The first Forest Management Division to have jurisdiction over the Sundarbans was established in 1869. In 1875 a large portion of the mangrove forests was declared as reserved forests under the Forest Act, 1865 (Act VIII of 1865). The remaining portions of the forests were declared a reserve forest the following year and the forest, which was so far administered by the civil administration district, was placed under the control of the Forest Department. A Forest Division, which is the basic forest management and administration unit, was created in 1879 with the headquarters in Khulna, Bangladesh. The first management plan was written for the period 1893–98. </p>
